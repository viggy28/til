A simple TIL where I share whatever new thing that I learn on the day.

## How to create a new TIL
til name-of-the-title

eg. ```til aws-networking-basics```

**Note: Don't forget to add the tags**

## How to add an image in a TIL
place the image in the doc directory
Refer that inside your TIL
eg. 
```![aws-networking-basics](aws-networking-basics.jpg)```
