# Memory-Smem

## Understanding free command

```other
vignesh@36ssds191:~$ free -g
			  total		used		free	  shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:			187		   4		   2		  27       180         152
Swap:			 0		   0		   0


vignesh@36ssds137:~$ free -g
			  total		used		free	  shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:			125		  68		   1		  27      56           26
Swap:			 0		   0		   0
```

total → total memory in the server = used+free+buff/cache

Used → total memory which has been used

buff/cache → The combined memory used by the kernel buffers and page cache and slabs. This memory can be reclaimed at any time if needed by the applications.

If you try to find the memory usage of Postgres using `top` or `ps` the value will be significantly higher.  When I ran 

````bash
ps -u stolon o pid,rss:8,cmd | awk 'NR>1 {A+=$2} {print} END{print "Total RSS: " A}'
````

I got `Total RSS: 1.33613e+10` which is way higher than the actual memory on the server.

So to find exactly the usage you can use [smem](https://www.selenic.com/smem/). 

USS -> Unique Set Size -- the portion of main memory that is occupied by a process and guaranteed to be private

RSS -> Resident Set Size -- the portion of memory that is occupied by a process held in main memory

PSS -> Proportional Set Size -- the portion of main memory that is occupied by a process and composed by private memory

smem can report PSS which is a more meaningful representation of the amount of memory used by applications.
