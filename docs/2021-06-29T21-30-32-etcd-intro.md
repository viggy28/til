# Etcd-Intro

A simple key-value db. 

Mainly I keep confused with all the configs that's used.

**listen-client-urls**:

    Local address where etcd server listens to

**listen-peer-urls:**

    Local address where etcd server listens for communicating to other members

**advertise-client-urls**:

    An URL my client applications will use to reach to etcd cluster

    If clients are running on different host, then they should be able to reach to this host

**initial-advertise-peer-urls**:

    An URL my etcd members will use to find other members during the bootstrap phase of the cluster

[A good explanantion on different bootstrap ways](https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/coreos/etcd/+/HEAD/Documentation/op-guide/clustering.md#static)
