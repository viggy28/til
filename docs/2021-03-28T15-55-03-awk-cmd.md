# AWK

I have used awk for many times, but there is always more to learn and every time I encounter something new.

To pass an outside variable to `awk` :

```other
awk -v v=$variablename
```

To pass multiple variables:

```other
awk -v v=$variablename v1=$variablename1
```

To run a command or an executable inside `awk` use `getline` function

Specific example for converting timestamp to epoch (assuming the $2 is a valid timestamp)

```other
awk {cmd="date -d" $2  " +\"%s\""
while( ( cmd | getline output) > 0 ) {
	echo "the value of the executed cmd is: " $output
}
```

Learnt that I can also use `system()` command, but that doesn't store the output to a variable, rather it prints to `stdout`.
