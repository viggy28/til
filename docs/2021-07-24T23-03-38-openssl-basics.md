# Openssl-Basics

OpenSSL is a widely popular library which implements/provides Transport Layer Socket (TLS).

BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL.

In OS X, LibreSSL version is available. 

`openssl version -a`

One of the interesting output to watch from that command is `OPENSSLDIR` which specifies what's the directory that openssl will use for its default configuration and root certificates.

Generally, the flow is as follow: (1) generate a private key, (2) create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and send it to a CA, and (3) install the CA-provided certificate in your web server.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not FIPS certified whereas BoringSSL is.

There is a plan to get OpenSSL 3.0.0 to be FIPS validated.
