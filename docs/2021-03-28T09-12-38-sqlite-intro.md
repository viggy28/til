# Sqlite-Intro

I have heard SQLITE, but never played with it. So I thought it would be nice to get my hands dirty with it.

Things to know:

SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files.

1. It doesn’t have a separate server process (like Postgres or MySQL)
2. SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files. - Does that mean its a simple ASCII text file that i can read using `less` or `cat` ? 
3. No installation required. Just download the package from [https://www.sqlite.org/download.html](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and run the executable `.sqlite3` 
```
visi@visis-MacBook-Pro sqlite-tools-osx-x86-3350300 % ./sqlite3 "test.db"
SQLite version 3.35.3 2021-03-26 12:12:52
```

```
sqlite> create table TIL(id integer, message varchar(100));
sqlite> select * from TIL;
sqlite>
sqlite> insert into TIL(1, "my first record inserted in to sqlite. yay !!");
Error: near "1": syntax error
sqlite>
sqlite> insert into TIL(1, 'my first record inserted in to sqlite. yay !!');
Error: near "1": syntax error
sqlite> insert into TIL values(1, 'my first record inserted in to sqlite. yay !!');
sqlite> select * from TIL;
1|my first record inserted in to sqlite. yay !!
```

```
visi@visis-MacBook-Pro sqlite-tools-osx-x86-3350300 % file test.db
test.db: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version 3035003
```

```
visi@visis-MacBook-Pro sqlite-tools-osx-x86-3350300 % cat test.db
��0qtablgmy first record inserted in to sqlite. yay !!%
```

Okay, not exactly ASCII text file, but almost.
