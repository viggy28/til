# Dm Dm-Crypt LUKS

What is device mapper (dm)?

A framework in Linux which helps to map physical block devices to virtual block devices. Forms the basis for LVM (logical volume manager), Software RAID.
Not to be confused multiple device (md) driver aka Linux. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23164384/what-is-the-difference-between-dm-and-md-in-linux-kernel
**sudo madm --detail /dev/mdn**
https://linux.die.net/man/4/md

Wait.. So what is block devices? For that I need to know what is a device file?

A **device file** or **special file** is an [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computer_science)) to a [device driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver) that appears in a [file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system) as if it were an ordinary [file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file)

More from WIKI, There are two general kinds of device files in Unix-like operating systems, known as character special files and block special files. The difference between them lies in how much data is read and written by the operating system and hardware. These together can be called device special files in contrast to named pipes, which are not connected to a device but are not ordinary files either.

The files which start with letter "b" and "c" represent block and character special files. They are interfaces between various device drivers and linux kernel. ref https://askubuntu.com/questions/722161/meaning-of-b-and-c-in-file-privileges-description-output-of-ls-l

Moving on to **Block Devices**?!

They provide buffered access to hardware devices. In Linux, default is block device (other one is character device).
**lsblk** - To list all the block devices in a server.

Up next, **dm-crypt**?

dm-crypt is the Linux kernel's device mapper crypto target. A transparent disk encryption subsystem in Linux kernel.

It is part of device mapper infrastructure and uses cryptographic routines from the kernelâ€™s Crypto API.

Next term I kept hearing was **LUKS.**

That is an extension for plain dm-crypt to give extra security and features

**LUKS header?**

When a device is encrypted with LUKS, the first part of the drive (aka header) contains important data (such as metadata, keyslots and SALT) which is necessary for decryption.

So what is this **SALT**?

The SALT is a random key with 256 bits, stored in the LUKS header (not kept secret). It will be used together with the passphrase when decrypting a LUKS device. The SALT will be appended to the passphrase.

Two types of RAID.

1. software

      mdraid or MD/RAID

      mdadm - utility to control software raid

2. hardware

Update1:
**cryptsetup**:
cryptsetup is used to conveniently setup dm-crypt managed device-mapper mappings. These include plain dm-crypt volumes and LUKS volumes.

 **dmsetup**:
low level logical volume management.

Update2:
More on block devices
