# Git-Submodules

Mainly used to avoid code redundancy. I think of it like a **pointer**. It helps avoiding copying pasting code from other repositories.

To enable that I need **.gitmodules** file. 

To clone a repo which has gitmodules I need to pass *--recurse-submodules* with **git clone** command
